############################################# \
######## USER CONFIG OVERRIDES FILE #########  + --> This will help you personalize my config to your printer :)
############################################# /

# This file is yours! Feel free to edit it in order to include all the needed
# things to adapt my generic config to your machine. This file will not be erased
# when updating the config using moonraker and it will be kept as you've set it.
# You can change every section of the config. You can also add some new custom macros, etc...
# The corresponding documentation can be found in: docs > overrides.md

### Also, keep in mind: if you use a multi-MCU config such as the old school double SKRs or a CANbus toolhead
### board, you will need to specify which components are connected to which board in your own mcu.cfg file!
### Example: if something is connected to the toolhead MCU, you should use "config_pin: toolhead:PIN_NAME".

#> Main control MCUs are called "mcu" (and "secondary" when using a double MCU configuration)
#> Toolhead CANboard MCUs are called "toolhead"
#> MMU/ERCF MCUs are called "mmu"

#   START_PRINT SEQUENCE  #
#-------------------------#

## The START_PRINT sequence is modular and fully customizable. A default START_PRINT sequence is auto-populated based on
## your probe choice (TAP, Dockable, Inductive), but if for some reasons you still want to modify it, please uncomment the following 3
## lines to define a new `variable_startprint_actions`. You can use any number of action or even duplicate some actions if needed.
## Available actions: "bed_soak", "extruder_preheating", "chamber_soak", "extruder_heating", "tilt_calib", "z_offset", "bedmesh", "purge", "clean", "primeline"
##
# [gcode_macro _USER_VARIABLES]
# variable_startprint_actions: "action1", "action2", ...
# gcode: # do not remove this line


#-------------------------#
#   EXTRUDER/BED PIDs     #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the PIDs. I put them here as almost everyone will use them,
## so just uncomment the following lines and change the values according to your own machine
[extruder]
control: pid
pid_kp: 26.015
pid_ki: 1.770
pid_kd: 95.603

[heater_bed]
heater_pin: PA1
sensor_type: Generic 3950
sensor_pin: PF3
max_power: 1
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 120
control: pid
pid_kp: 38.771
pid_ki: 1.746
pid_kd: 215.177


#-------------------------#
#   Z MOTORS DIRECTION    #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for the motor directions as it's a pretty common one. If you need
## to invert the Z1 or Z3 motor direction on your machine, just uncomment the following lines.
# [stepper_z1]
# dir_pin: !Z1_DIR

# [stepper_z3]
# dir_pin: !Z3_DIR


#-------------------------#
#   Probe Offsets         #
#-------------------------#

## Here is an example of some overrides for bed probes. These frequently have calibrated offsets for xyz,
## and many will need them during setup. If you need to set these, just uncomment the following lines.
#[probe]
#x_offset: 0
#y_offset: 0
#z_offset: 0

[beacon]
serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Beacon_Beacon_RevH_5FF1AD784E5737374D202020FF071D17-if00
#home_method: contact
#home_method_when_homed: proximity
#home_autocalibrate: unhomed

[temperature_sensor NH36]
sensor_type: temperature_mcu
sensor_mcu: toolhead
min_temp: 0
max_temp: 100

[stepper_x]
endstop_pin: toolhead:X_STOP

[fan_generic cab]
pin: PE5
kick_start_time: 0.5
max_power: 0.5

[fan_generic filter]
pin: PA8
kick_start_time: 0.5
